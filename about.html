            During this past year, the COVID-19 pandemic has turned our lives upside down and changed not just
            the way we live and work but also how we think and behave. Every part of the world has been affected, and
            every aspect of life has been impacted. Our everyday routines were brought to a stop, and any sense of
            normalcy was lost. While we stop and look at the world around us, I cannot help but realize what I used to
            take for granted. If anything, perhaps there are some life lessons to take away from this pandemic.

            1. This world is interconnected. We often think of each country as a separate entity and being very
            different from one another. Within a few months of the virus first being identified, the virus spread to
            nearly every country, and a global pandemic was declared. Despite the differences and distance between
            places, we are battling the same virus and having the same struggles. It’s a reminder of just how our world
            economy and society are interconnected on many levels, including supply chains, communications, technology,
            and travel.
            2. Humans are social creatures, and we need social interaction and human contact. The COVID-19
            pandemic has highlighted the importance of social interaction and human contact within almost every aspect
            of our lives, including education, employment, entertainment, and recreation. Efforts to reduce the spread
            of the virus, including physical distancing, quarantine, and stay-at-home orders, have prompted and
            exacerbated social isolation and loneliness. Along with 35 million other individuals (accounting for 28% of
            the population) in the United States, I live alone, and this has meant little to no social interactions for
            months. And as much as I consider myself an independent person who has lived on their own for years and
            moved numerous times to new cities without knowing anyone there, this pandemic has made me realize how much
            I miss social interaction and things as simple as a hug or coffee with a friend at the café.

            3. Humans are adaptive, and life is more flexible than we think. The pandemic has been a time of
            extraordinary change, and we have had to rapidly change and adapt to the evolving situation. Many
            individuals have lost jobs and have been forced to find creative ways to pay the bills. Many others began
            working from home. Schools turned online with virtual learning. Many physicians started offering
            telemedicine. This pandemic has been a testament to just how resilient we are as humans and our ability to
            be flexible and creative in the face of uncertainty.

            4. There is goodness and humanity, even in the darkness. At the start of the pandemic, there was a shortage
            of personal protective equipment (PPE) among hospitals and health care facilities, and many health care
            workers were reusing the same disposable mask for days or weeks at a time. Immediately, community members
            gathered together to procure masks, 3D print face shields, and hand sew masks and scrub caps for health care
            workers. Restaurants were donating food to hospital workers and first responders. And people were
            volunteering to bring groceries to the elderly. These acts of kindness and appreciation from the community
            has helped keep me and many of my fellow health care workers going, working day after day during this
            pandemic.

            5. Life is precious. Be grateful for what we have. With over 225 thousand lives lost to the pandemic in the
            United States to date (and over 1.1 million worldwide), this pandemic has made me re-think my priorities and
            remember how precious life is. It has been a reminder to appreciate the smaller things in life – the things
            I often take for granted. With so many deaths each day, I am grateful for my family and friends, even if it
            means video calls and text messages while we cannot see each other in-person. With so many people falling
            ill, I am grateful for my health. With so many people losing jobs and becoming homeless, I am grateful for
            the food in my fridge and a place to call home. This pandemic has made me re-evaluate my life and assess my
            priorities and served as a reminder of how precious life is and appreciate the small things in life.

            pandemic.
